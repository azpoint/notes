Perfect â€” the `**` operator in Python is a really important one, and it behaves differently depending on **where** you use it. Letâ€™s go through it carefully.

---

## 1. `**` in **function calls**

When you call a function, `**` unpacks a **dictionary** into keyword arguments.

Example:

```python
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!")

person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

greet(**person)  
# Equivalent to greet(name="Alice", age=25)
```

âœ… Output:

```
Hello Alice, you are 25 years old!
```

So `**person` means:

* take the keys of the dict as parameter names
* take the values as parameter values

---

## 2. `**` in **dictionary literals**

Inside a dictionary, `**` expands another dictionaryâ€™s key-value pairs into the new one.

Example:

```python
a = {"x": 1, "y": 2}
b = {"y": 99, "z": 3}

merged = {**a, **b}
print(merged)
```

âœ… Output:

```python
{"x": 1, "y": 99, "z": 3}
```

Here:

* `**a` puts `{"x": 1, "y": 2}` into the new dictionary.
* `**b` puts `{"y": 99, "z": 3}`, overriding `"y"`.

---

## 3. Multiple `**` expansions

You can combine multiple dicts and add new keys:

```python
person = {"name": "Alice"}
details = {"age": 25, "city": "Paris"}

profile = {**person, **details, "country": "France"}
print(profile)
```

âœ… Output:

```python
{"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Paris", "country": "France"}
```

---

## 4. Order matters

If the same key appears multiple times, the **last one wins**.

```python
data = {**{"a": 1}, **{"a": 2}}
print(data)  # {"a": 2}
```

---

## Why your code uses `**`

In your line:

```python
return {**db[last_id], "id": last_id}
```

* `**db[last_id]` unpacks all shipment fields.
* `"id": last_id` adds a new field.

So if `db[last_id] = {"destination": "Tokyo", "status": "Pending"}`,
it builds:

```python
{"destination": "Tokyo", "status": "Pending", "id": 3}
```

ðŸ‘‰ Quick check: do you want me to also explain the difference between `*` and `**` unpacking (lists/tuples vs dicts)?
